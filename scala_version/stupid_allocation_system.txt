Stupidest register allocation system:

- Choose a register for all real variables mentioned in the block. They live there. Load all of them.
- Whenever you need a temp variable, pick a register which contains a temp variable which is never read again, and stick it there.
- At the end of the block, store all the real variables in their places.
